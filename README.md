# PasswordGenerator
Another challange I decided to do with my friend BloodyDevil.
This time we decided to make a password generator. We had 25 minutes to do it.

# How it works
The generator on launch, generates a keychain.dll file
The file is actually a text file, and can be edited at will.
It contains the characters the script can use to create a password.
Using random, it takes random characters from the keychain.dll file, and it throws them togeder, to get to the required length.
You are given an option, to encode the password. This is where hashlib is used.

You can see more exactly how the script works, in the source code.

# Compiling Requirements
In order to run or compile the source code, you need hashlib module for python. The other modules are time and random, however they should be pre-installed.

# Pssst
